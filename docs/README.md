Package cfw contains ports of a few selected CFWheels v1 helpers that are used for string manipulation and have no Go equivalent.

>[CFWheels](https://cfwheels.org/) is an open-source [CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language)](http://lucee.org/) framework inspired by Ruby on Rails that provides fast application development, a great organization system for your code, and is just plain fun to use.

I created this package as I had been migrating CFWheels web applications over to Go. They had a few dependencies that need recreation to ensure a smooth transition.
